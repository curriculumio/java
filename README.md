### Fundamentals

We take an innovative approach to teaching Java by first introducing procedural programming through graphics and animations. The [introductory game design path](game-design) teaches students to [create artwork with a computer](drawing), [simulate physical phenomenon](physics) and [create their own games](simple-games).

We then teach [problem solving](problem-solving), where students solve many simple math and logic problems to reinforce fundamental thinking patterns. In this path, we introduce computational thinking and the details behind Java syntax.

### Object-oriented programming

Once students are comfortable with procedural programming, we move on to object-oriented programming, which we introduce by recreating popular games like [agar.io](agar), [simulating bacteria growth](simulations#bacteria), and [modeling complex physical phenomenon](simulations#gravity).

### Data Structures

We cover all the standard data structures like [linked lists](linked-lists) and [binary trees](binary-tree). We will also cover applications of these data structures to games like [snake](linked-lists#snake) and [20 questions](binary-tree#20-questions).
